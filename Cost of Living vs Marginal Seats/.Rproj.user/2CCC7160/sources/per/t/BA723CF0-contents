**üîç Project Overview** 

This project is a personal exploration of how cost of living indicators
(like rent and mortgage payments) intersect with marginal seats from the
2022 Australian Federal Election, focusing on Victoria.

I was curious: Are voters in marginal electorates more vulnerable to
financial stress? To investigate this, I combined election result data
with census data from 2016 and 2021, visualizing key metrics
geographically using R.

# üß© Identifying Marginal Seats in Victoria

##  Load and filter election results to find marginal seats won with \<56% of preference votes.

```{r}

election_data <- read.csv("data/HouseDopByDivisionDownload-27966.csv", skip = 1)

  
# Filter to only include seats in Victoria
Marginal_seats <- election_data %>%
  filter(StateAb == "VIC") %>% 
  
# Filter to only Preference Count
  filter(CalculationType == "Preference Percent" & Elected == "Y") %>%
      group_by(DivisionNm) %>%  
  
# Filter Marginal winning seats less than 56%
  filter(CountNumber == max(CountNumber))
Marginal_seats <- Marginal_seats %>% select(StateAb,DivisionNm,CountNumber,Surname,GivenNm,PartyNm, PartyAb,CalculationType, CalculationValue) %>%
  mutate(marginal = ifelse(CalculationValue < 56 , "Y" , "N")) %>% filter(marginal == "Y") %>%
  mutate(DivisionNm=toupper(DivisionNm))%>% arrange(DivisionNm)

Marginal_seats

```

## Load electoral boundaries to prepare for visualisation

```{r }
library(sf)
vic_map <- read_sf(here::here("data/vic-july-2021-esri/E_VIC21_region.shp"), quiet = TRUE) %>% 
  rename(DivisionNm = Elect_div) %>% 
  mutate(DivisionNm = toupper(DivisionNm))
   # to match up with election data
vic_map <- st_zm(vic_map)
```

##  Set political party colours

```{r party-colours, eval=TRUE}
# define the political colors (feel free to change)
party_colors <- c("ALP" = "#DE3533", "LNP" = "#ADD8E6", 
                  "KAP" = "#8B0000", "GRN" = "#10C25B", 
                  "GVIC" = "#10C25B", "XEN" = "#ff6300", 
                  "LP" = "#0047AB", "NP" = "#0a9cca", 
                  "IND" = "#000000")

```

##  Map the marginal seat winners in Victoria

```{r plotting}

ggplot(left_join(vic_map, Marginal_seats, by = "DivisionNm")) +
  geom_sf(aes(geometry = geometry, fill = PartyAb), color = "black", size = 1.8) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(140.9617, 149.9763), ylim = c(-39.15919, -33.98043)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = party_colors) +
  ggtitle("Winners of Marginal Seats") + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(nrow = 1))

```

## Enrolment Data

```{r}
enrolment_div <- read_csv("data/GeneralEnrolmentByDivisionDownload-27966.csv", skip = 1)

enrolment_div %>% mutate(DivisionNm = toupper(DivisionNm)) %>%
left_join(enrolment_div ,
          by = "DivisionNm")


enrolment_div %>%
  select(1,2,3,11)
  
```

# üè† Comparing Housing and Income Data in 2016 vs 2021

##  Load Census Data

```{r}
# Load the census2016 dataset
SA1_2016 <- here::here("data/Geopackage_2016_EIUWA_for_VIC/census2016_eiuwa_vic_short.gpkg")
census_2016 <- read_sf(SA1_2016, layer = "census2016_eiuwa_vic_sa1_short")



# Load the G02 dataset
SA1_2021 <- here::here("data/Geopackage_2021_G02_VIC_GDA94/G02_VIC_GDA94.gpkg")
census_2021 <- read_sf(SA1_2021, layer = "G02_SA1_2021_VIC")


```

- üîé Limitations:

There are `r nrow(census_2016)` and `r nrow(census_2021)` observations
in the data due to which comparison is not possible.

The 2016 and 2021 datasets use different geographical identifiers,
making direct comparisons at SA1 level tricky.


##  Visualise Weekly Rent

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
census_2016 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Median_rent_weekly)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  ggtitle("Median Weekly Rent by Area") +
  xlab("Median For Rent ") +
  ylab("Count Of Rent ($)")

summary(census_2016$Median_rent_weekly)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
census_2021 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Median_rent_weekly)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  ggtitle("Median Weekly Rent by Area") +
  xlab("Median For Rent ") +
  ylab("Count Of Rent ($)")

summary(census_2021$Median_rent_weekly)
```

-   The Median in 2016 and 2021 is different as the rent in 2021 has
    increased and crossed the mark of 4000 while in 2016 the it was
    above 3000.

##  Visualise Weekly Household Income

```{r}

census_2016 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Median_tot_hhd_inc_weekly))+ 
  geom_histogram() + 
  ggtitle("Median Weekly Income by Area") +
  xlab("HouseHold Income") +
  ylab("Median Weekly Income ($)")

summary(census_2016$Median_tot_hhd_inc_weekly) 
```

```{r}
census_2021 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Median_tot_hhd_inc_weekly)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  ggtitle("Median Weekly Income by Area ") +
  xlab("HouseHold Income") +
  ylab("Median Weekly Income ($)")

summary(census_2021$Median_tot_hhd_inc_weekly) 
```

-   The income has increased for weekly household in 2021 by over 500 as
    compared to what it was in 2016.

### üîé Limitations of Using 30% Rule as Stress Indicator

Lack of precision: Using the average housing cost and 30% of the average
household income as proxy for mortgage/rental stress can only give a
ballpark figure. Individual circumstances, such as the number of
dependents, work status, and other elements that influence household
income and expenses are not taken into consideration.

Regional variations: Housing expenses can vary widely from one place to
another. Victoria's diverse housing markets might not be adequately
represented by a single criterion applied to the entire state.

Data gaps: The census does not fully account for costs associated with
dwelling, such as utilities, property taxes, and maintenance costs.As
such, comparing the median amount of money spent on housing to 30% of
the median household income may not give a complete picture of the
financial stress faced by households.

Changes over time: Due to changes in the housing market and the wider
economy over time, comparing the median amount spent on housing in 2016
and 2021 and the 30% criterion may not be appropriate. For instance,
changes in interest rates, rental costs, and household earnings over
time may all have an impact on the percentage of households that are
stressed out about their mortgage or rent.

# üìçMapping Cost of Living Stress by Electorate (Personal Spatial Analysis)

In this section, I explored how spatial divisions (SA1 regions) align
with federal electorates in Victoria. My main goal was to visualise and
compare cost of living indicators between marginal and non-marginal
seats using Census 2021 data.

## üß≠ Mapping SA1s to Divisions

```{r}

joined_map_2016 <- st_join(st_centroid(census_2016), vic_map) %>%
  st_join(census_2016 %>% select(sa1_7digitcode_2016), .)

ggplot(data = joined_map_2016) +
   geom_sf(aes(geometry = geom, fill = DivisionNm)) +
  geom_sf(data = vic_map,
          aes(geometry = geometry), col = "red", fill = "transparent")
```

```{r}
joined_map_2021 <- st_join(st_centroid(census_2021), vic_map) %>%
  st_join(census_2021 %>% select(SA1_CODE_2021), .)

ggplot(data = joined_map_2021) +
   geom_sf(aes(geometry = geom, fill = DivisionNm)) +
  geom_sf(data = vic_map,
          aes(geometry = geometry), col = "red", fill = "transparent")
```

```{r}
SA1_Melb_2016 <- joined_map_2016 %>%
  filter(DivisionNm == "MELBOURNE")

SA1_Melb_2021 <- joined_map_2021 %>%
  filter(DivisionNm == "MELBOURNE")

```

The number of SA1 Regions in Melbourne in 2016 are
`r nrow(SA1_Melb_2016)` and in 2021 are `r nrow(SA1_Melb_2021)`.

##  üìä Calculating Average Cost Indicators for Melbourne

```{r}
Mean_Melb <- SA1_Melb_2021%>%
  summarise(Mean_mortgage_repay_monthly_2021 = mean(Median_mortgage_repay_monthly),
            Mean_rent_weekly_2021 = mean(Median_rent_weekly),
            Mean_tot_hhd_inc_weekly_2021 = mean(Median_tot_hhd_inc_weekly))
```

üìå Process Recap:

-   Loaded both 2016 and 2021 GeoPackage datasets.
-   Filtered Victoria's data to focus on Melbourne's SA1s.
-   Calculated the mean for mortgage, rent, and household income
    indicators across these areas.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: These means are derived from median values per SA1, not raw
income or housing payments. As such, it's an approximation for
high-level comparison only.

## üìç Visualising Cost of Living in Marginal vs Non-Marginal
      Electorates

I calculated cost of living ratios --- rent/income and mortgage/income
--- across marginal and non-marginal electorates to explore spatial
inequalities.

```{r}
marginal_joined_map_2021 <- joined_map_2021 %>%
  filter(DivisionNm %in% c("ASTON", "CASEY", "DEAKIN", "GOLDSTEIN", "HIGGINS", "KOOYONG", "MCEWEN", "MENZIES", "MONASH", "NICHOLLS", "WANNON"))

costofliving_marginial <- marginal_joined_map_2021 %>%
  mutate(col_rent = (Median_rent_weekly/Median_tot_hhd_inc_weekly),
         col_mortgage = (Median_mortgage_repay_monthly/Median_tot_hhd_inc_weekly))

```

## Rent Stress: Marginal Seats

```{r}

col_rent_map <- costofliving_marginial %>%
   mutate(centroid = st_centroid(geom)) %>%
   filter(Median_age_persons != 0)

ggplot(col_rent_map) +
   geom_sf(aes(geometry = centroid, color = col_rent), shape = 3) +
   geom_sf(data = vic_map, aes(geometry = geometry), fill = "transparent", size = 1.3, color = "black") +
   coord_sf(xlim = c(144.8, 145.2), ylim = c(-38.1, -37.6)) +
   scale_color_viridis_c(name = "Rent For Marginal Seats", option = "magma")

```

```{r}
nonmarginal_joined_map_2021 <- joined_map_2021 %>%
  filter(!(DivisionNm %in% c("ASTON", "CASEY", "DEAKIN", "GOLDSTEIN", "HIGGINS", "KOOYONG", "MCEWEN", "MENZIES", "MONASH", "NICHOLLS", "WANNON")))

costofliving_nonmarginial <- nonmarginal_joined_map_2021 %>%
  mutate(col_rent = (Median_rent_weekly/Median_tot_hhd_inc_weekly),
         col_mortgage = (Median_mortgage_repay_monthly/Median_tot_hhd_inc_weekly))


```

## Rent Stress: Non-Marginal Seats

```{r}

col_rent_map_non <- costofliving_nonmarginial %>%
   mutate(centroid = st_centroid(geom)) %>%
   filter(Median_age_persons != 0)

ggplot(col_rent_map_non) +
   geom_sf(aes(geometry = centroid, color = col_rent), shape = 3) +
   geom_sf(data = vic_map, aes(geometry = geometry), fill = "transparent", size = 1.3, color = "black") +
   coord_sf(xlim = c(144.8, 145.2), ylim = c(-38.1, -37.6)) +
   scale_color_viridis_c(name = "Rent For Non-Marginal Seats", option = "magma")

```

## üí∞ Mortgage Stress: Marginal vs Non-Marginal

```{r}

col_mortgage_map <- costofliving_marginial %>%
   mutate(centroid = st_centroid(geom)) %>%
   filter(Median_age_persons != 0)

ggplot(col_mortgage_map) +
   geom_sf(aes(geometry = centroid, color = col_mortgage), shape = 3) +
   geom_sf(data = vic_map, aes(geometry = geometry), fill = "transparent", size = 1.3, color = "black") +
   coord_sf(xlim = c(144.8, 145.2), ylim = c(-38.1, -37.6)) +
   scale_color_viridis_c(name = "Mortgage For Marginal Seats", option = "magma")

```

```{r}
col_mortgage_map_non <- costofliving_nonmarginial %>%
   mutate(centroid = st_centroid(geom)) %>%
   filter(Median_age_persons != 0)

ggplot(col_mortgage_map_non) +
   geom_sf(aes(geometry = centroid, color = col_mortgage), shape = 3) +
   geom_sf(data = vic_map, aes(geometry = geometry), fill = "transparent", size = 1.3, color = "black") +
   coord_sf(xlim = c(144.8, 145.2), ylim = c(-38.1, -37.6)) +
   scale_color_viridis_c(name = "Mortgage For Non-Marginal Seats", option = "magma")
```


# üßæ Key Findings & Reflections

- Our analysis of the 2021 Census data suggests that voters in marginal
seats are facing a greater impact from the cost of living crisis than
those in other electorates. We estimated the median amount of money
spent on housing (mortgage/rent). We found that a higher percentage of
voters in marginal seats were in mortgage or rental stress compared to
other electorates.

- Additionally, we estimated the mean of several economic variables for
each electorate, including Median_mortgage_repay_monthly,
Median_rent_weekly, and Median_tot_hhd_inc_weekly. We found that in
marginal seats, the median values for Median_mortgage_repay_monthly and
Median_rent_weekly were higher than the median values for other
electorates. The median value for Median_tot_hhd_inc_weekly in marginal
seats was lower than that of other electorates.

- However, it is important to note that the census data has limitations,
particularly when it comes to small sample sizes in some electorates.
Therefore, the results may not be entirely representative of the entire
electorate. Additionally, these findings do not account for other
factors that may contribute to the cost of living, such as transport or
energy costs.

- In conclusion, our analysis suggests that voters in marginal seats are
being impacted more by the cost of living crisis than voters in other
electorates. We recommend that the Labor Party take into account these
findings when developing policies aimed at addressing the cost of living
crisis.
